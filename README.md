# iCloud Drive Browser

An app that lets the user browse files on iCloud Drive, and open them in other apps.

I hope Apple adds a native solution in iOS 9, but until then, I guess this will have to suffice.

## Goals

- Preview all files that can be natively opened by iOS
- Provide a solution to open files in other apps, regardless of whether iOS can natively open them.

## Current Limitations

- Can only display PDFs.
- Can't open files in other apps.
- Only works on iPhones. I've no idea why I can't run it on an iPad, but that's still being sorted out.
- The only way to display the document picker once it's been dismissed is to restart the app.
