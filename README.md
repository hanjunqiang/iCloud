# iCloud Drive Browser

An app that lets the user browse files on iCloud Drive, and open them in other apps.

I hope Apple adds a native solution in iOS 9, but until then, I guess this will have to suffice.

## Goals

- Preview all files that can be natively opened by iOS.
- Provide the ability to open files in other apps.

## Current Limitations

- Can't open files in other apps. This works fine on iOS Simulator, so I can't quite fathom why it doesn't work on device.
